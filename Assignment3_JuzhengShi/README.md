+ .ipynb file and .py file have almost the same content, .py file is recommended and you can see more intermediate output in .ipynb file
+ I use `pysark-submit` to run the .py file following the format below:
    + `pyspark-submit <your-path>/Assignment3_JuzhengShi/Assignment3.py <your-path>/Assignment3_JuzhengShi/`
